            <h3>In this page, I'll let you know more about me.</h3>
            <h5>Welcome to Yury Trochin's Website</h5>
            <p>
Hello and thank you for visiting! My name is Yury Trochin, and I am excited to share my story, passions, and achievements with you through this digital portfolio. While my roots trace back to Russia, my formative years and education have blossomed in Assam, India—a place I fondly call home. This unique multicultural background has shaped my worldview, my approach to learning, and the diverse interests I pursue.
</p>
<h2>
Early Life and Academic Excellence</h2>
<p>
Born and brought up in Assam, I started my educational journey at Royal Global School, where curiosity and dedication to learning were always encouraged. Throughout my schooling till class 10, I immersed myself deeply in academics and participated enthusiastically in numerous competitions. One of my proudest moments was securing International Rank 1 in the International English Olympiad, a recognition that continues to motivate me. I have also been honored with multiple awards in other olympiads, such as the Science Olympiad and the Mathematics Olympiad, consistently ranking among the top performers.
</p>
<h2>
Extracurricular Achievements</h2>
<p>
Academics aside, I have always believed in maintaining a balance between learning and play. My years at Royal Global School were also marked by significant success in extracurricular activities. I became the state champion in skating for five consecutive years, and have earned medals in basketball and football at intramural meets. Sport has taught me discipline, resilience, and the importance of teamwork—qualities that I strive to bring into all aspects of my life.
</p>
<h2>
Senior Secondary and Competitive Exams</h2>
<p>
After completing class 10, I continued my studies at Maria's Public School, Guwahati. Here, I redirected my focus toward preparing for college entrance exams—a challenging but rewarding phase of my journey. Diligent preparation helped me achieve a respectable rank in JEE Mains and Advanced, and I also scored in the 98th percentile on the SAT, opening doors for higher education in competitive environments.
</p>
<h2>
Pursuing My Dream: Computer Science at DTU</h2>
<p>
All the hard work culminated in my admission to Delhi Technological University (DTU), Computer Science branch—a dream come true. Ever since I first discovered my passion for technology, I knew that Computer Science, and particularly game development, was the path I wanted to pursue. DTU has provided the ideal platform for me to build technical expertise, collaborate with talented peers, and participate in vibrant campus life.
</p>
<h2>
College Life and Recent Achievements</h2>
<p>
Since joining DTU, I have thrown myself into new challenges and opportunities. Within my first few months, I proudly represented the DTU boxing team at Spardha 2025, where I won a gold medal for my college. These experiences highlight my drive to excel, both inside and outside the classroom.
